Playground - Code Scraps
=========

Simply a vault for storing random pieces of code and scripts that I've used at some point or another.

* Algorithms - various scripts used in solving past code challenges
* Aurora - Top Down Shooter for Windows/XBOX implemented with C# and XNA
* Cartoon - experimental code for cartoonifying an image
* CSG - transform color space gradient for images
* Larsson - [NOT COMPLETE] Matlab implementation of Fourier transform for the SVCJ model (Larsson, Nossman 2011, Appendix B)
* Puzzles - more algorithm challenges
* Web Scraping - Python Functions involved in scraping data from webpages
* Wu Tao Qin - Matlab implementation of stability for interval neural networks (Wi, Tao, Qin 2011, Figures 1 & 2)
