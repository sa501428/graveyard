Graveyard - Code Scraps
=========

Simply a vault for storing random pieces of code and scripts that I've used at some point or another.

* Web Scraping - functions involved in parsing webpage for a python scraper
* Larsson - Matlab implementation of Fourier transform for the SVCJ model (Larsson, Nossman 2011, Appendix B)
* Aurora - Top Down Shooter for Windows/XBOX implemented with C# and XNA
