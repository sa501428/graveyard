Graveyard - Code Scraps
=========

Simply a vault for storing random pieces of code and scripts that I've used at some point or another.

* Aurora - Top Down Shooter for Windows/XBOX implemented with C# and XNA
* CSG - Matlab code which performs colorspace gradient transformation on a given image
* Larsson - Matlab implementation of Fourier transform for the SVCJ model (Larsson, Nossman 2011, Appendix B)
* Web Scraping - Python Functions involved in scraping data from webpages
* Wu Tao Qin - Matlab implementation of stability for interval neural networks (Wi, Tao, Qin 2011, Figures 1 & 2)
